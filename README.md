# ChatGPT
ChatGPT is a simple web application that allows you to chat with OpenAI's GPT-3 AI model. You can speak with the AI, teach it new things, and save your conversations to your local machine.
## Features
ChatGPT has the following features:
- Speakable response: The AI's response can be spoken aloud by your browser.
- Teachable AI: You can teach the AI new things by providing it with examples of how to respond to certain inputs.
- Local data storage: Your conversations with the AI are stored locally on your machine using the browser's local storage API. No login is required to use this app.
